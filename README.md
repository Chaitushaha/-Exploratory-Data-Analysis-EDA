# -Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Netflix dataset using Python to identify patterns, trends, and insights through data visualization.
#Project Overview.
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Netflix dataset.
The goal is to understand the data, identify patterns, and extract useful insights using visualizations.

# Dataset Description
The dataset contains information about Netflix Movies and TV Shows such as:
Content type (Movie / TV Show)
Release year
Rating
Duration
Other categorical and numerical features

# Data Cleaning
Before analysis, the dataset was cleaned:
Missing values were handled
Incorrect or inconsistent values were checked
Data types were verified

# Exploratory Data Analysis
The following visualizations were created to analyze the data:
1. Release Year Distribution (Histogram)
Most titles were released after 2015, showing a rapid increase in Netflix content in recent years.
2. Content Type Distribution (Count Plot)
Movies are more common than TV Shows, indicating Netflix focuses more on movies.
3. Rating Distribution (Count Plot)
TV-MA and TV-14 are the most common ratings, which means most content is made for mature audiences.
4. Duration Analysis (Box Plot)
Most titles have similar duration, but a few titles show very high duration, which are outliers.
5. Correlation Analysis (Heatmap)
There is no strong correlation between most numerical features, indicating independent behavior.

# Important Features for Prediction
Based on EDA, the following features are important:
Content type
Release year
Rating
Duration
These features can be useful for prediction and further analysis.

# Conclusion
Netflix content increased significantly after 2015
Movies dominate the platform
Mature-rated content is most common
Duration contains some outliers
Key features were identified for modeling
